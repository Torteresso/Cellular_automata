PRESENTATION
============

My first try to make cellular automata in c++ using SMFL.

Current state : 

- game of life (2 types of cells : dead and alive)
- ability to start from random grid
- ability to draw cell on the grid using the mouse (left click to draw, right click to change type of cell)
- 2 more type of cells : empty and propagator
- others abilities which are in "configuration.h"

HOW TO USE IT
=============

If you want to test it, you should download:  

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

And then you can clone it in Visual Studio Community 2022.
